Exercise 4                           ==========================================================
CREATED BY : Arbel Hizmi

Program description:
In "Exercise 4" we have three different programs: btree.h, btree.cpp, LinkedList.h, LinkedList.cpp, main.cpp

btree.h –the file btree.h define struce ode with the data members of node* right, node* left and int key value.
it also have a class of btree with the data member node* root for the root of the tree,
and the boolean "isMirror" to know if mirror function was activated.
in the file can be found method which defined for us in the assignment, and private method 
i created to use in the cpp file. explanation for each method can be found in the cpp file

btree.cpp –the btree.cpp file use all the functions which define in the header file.
the file use copy constructors(with tree and list) and = operators(with tree and list)
and use a destructor. the file also use private function which also define in the header files.

LinkedList.h –the file LinkedList.h define class Node with the data members of Node* next, and int data.
it also have a class of LinkedList with the data members of int length, and Node* for the head 
of the list as a pointer.
in the file can be found method which defined for us in the assignment, and private method 
i created to use in the cpp file. explanation for each method can be found in the cpp file

LinkedList.cpp –the LinkedList.cpp file use all the functions which define in the header file.
the file use copy constructors (with tree and list) and = operators (with tree and list)
and use a destructor. the file also use private function which also define in the header files.

main.cpp –the main use functions and methods from the LinkedList and btree files.
specification for methods and funcitons can be found in the other files

Program files: 
btree.h – source code of btree.h
btree.cpp – source code of btree.cpp
LinkedList.h – source code of LinkedList.h
LinkeList.cpp – source code of LinkedList.cpp
main.cpp – source code of main.cpp

Compile and running: 
In Visual Studio IDE
To compile: Ctrl + shift + b 
To run: Ctrl + f5 

Input:
the input is in the main. the input is the same as Assaf attached to the home assignment.

Output:
the output is in the main. the input is the same as Assaf attached to the home assignment.
